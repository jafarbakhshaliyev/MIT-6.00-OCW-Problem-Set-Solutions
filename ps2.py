# Problem 2

# Theorem: If it is possible to buy x, x+1,â€¦, x+5 sets of McNuggets, for some x, then it is
# possible to buy any number of McNuggets >= x, given that McNuggets come in 6, 9 and 20 packs.

# You can find the numbers which is greater and equal by x with just adding the smallest integer 6, and it is
